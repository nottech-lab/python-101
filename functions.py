   # FUNCTIONS.
# function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once.
# They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.
# functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again. 
# function in Python is defined by a def statement. The general syntax looks like this

    This is where the function's Document String (doc-string) goes

# definining and calling a simple function.
