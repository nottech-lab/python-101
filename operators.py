# BASIC OPERATORS.

# NUMERIC OPERATORS.

x = 5
y = 6.0

print(x+y) # additon

print(x*y) # multiplication

print(x**y) # power

print(20%6) # remainder

print(y//x) # floor division

 # LOGIC OPERATORS.

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30

print(c)

# == (equal to)) : Compares if the objects are equal

if a == b:
    print('a is equal to b')

else:
    print('a is not equal to b')
    
# != (not equal to): : Compares if the objects are not equal

m, n = 3, 2

if m != n:
    print(' m is not equal to n')

# not : (boolean NOT)


# and (boolean AND)

c = a % b

print(c)

# or (boolean OR)

c = a | b

print(c)
# > (greater than): Returns whether x is greater than y

x, y = 5, 3

if x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
# < (less than): Returns whether x is less than y.

if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
    
# <= (less than or equal to)

if x <= y:
    print('x is equal to y')
else:
    print('x is not equal to y')
        
# >= (greater than or equal to)

if x >= y:
    print('x is equal to y')
else:
    print('x is not equal to y')
