    # TUPLES.
    
# Lists are immutable means has the fixed value which can not be altered.

# A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:

tup = (2, 5, "name", 8, 10)

print(tup) # the output is always in paranthesis.

a, b, c, d, e = tup # assign in a reverse

print(tup) # it gives the same values.

print(tup[2]) # print the third value in a tuple

print(tup[1:]) # it gives an output of tuple with second to last item.

tup1 = (12, 22, 15)

print(max(tup1)) # it gives the maximum value in the tuple.

print(min(tup1)) # it gives the minimum value in the tuple.
